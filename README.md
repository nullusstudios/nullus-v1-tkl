# Nullus v1 (name undecided) (THIS PROJECT IS BEING ACTIVELY UPDATED, THERE ARE PICTURES IN THE KEYBOARD-TALK CHANNEL IN THE MYKEYCLUB DISCORD)

Make sure that two of the badge magnets are produced. Designs for the badge have not been done as of this moment. Please suggest design elements that should be removed or added.

On another note, is it possible to inlay WEIGHTINLAY into WEIGHTBIGINLAY via inlay cladding? Also, the screwholes need to be threaded.

At the current moment, I do have a PCB designed, but I am unsure if it's actually good. I also based the daughterboard off of what Geon uses, the Fly (https://www.vwolf.be/). You guys can redesign or just use a different PCB and daughterboard outright if needed.
